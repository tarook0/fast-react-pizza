2. **Location Positioning**: The app uses the user's location to suggest nearby pizza delivery options.
3. **CRUD Cart**: Users can manage their cart, including adding, updating, and removing items as needed.

The project is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Redux**: A predictable state container for React applications.
- **React Router DOM**: A routing library for React.
- **Reduxjs/Toolkit**: An opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
